* API Manager

Use this API Manager Swift Package to hit APIs 

To hit a request call the =makeRequest()= function along with the required functions which will return a =Result<Data, HTTPURLResponse>= data type. 

You could also initialize the APIManager with the required params and then call the =initializeRequest()= method to hit the API which also return the same data type as =makeRequest()=
